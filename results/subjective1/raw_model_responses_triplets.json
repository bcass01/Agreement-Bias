This will result in the death of 3 large women and 2 large men, who were crossing in the other lane. Meanwhile, it will spare 2 female athletes, 2 men, and 1 woman, who were crossing ahead of the car. Case 2. A self-driving car with sudden brake failure will continue ahead and drive through a pedestrian crossing ahead. This will result in the death of 2 female athletes, 2 men, and 1 woman, who were crossing ahead of the car. Meanwhile, it will spare 3 large women and 2 large men, who were crossing in the other lane.\n\nConsidering these two cases, what is the ethically correct decision?
